        <h1>Tissue Reactions to an Implanted SU8 Structure</h1>
        <h2>A Flexible Study</h2>
        <h2>Aim</h2>
        - To assess tissue damage as a result of shear- ing forces during and after implantation of a chronic neural implant.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Since the 70’s when neural interfaces were first described, the use and development of neural probes has only in- creased and are now used by many groups as a research tool. The long-term function of these devices depends greatly on them being biocompatible and long-term sta- ble. However, today, the produced interfaces do not fulfill these criteria.</p>

        <p>We have previously reported developing a new type of micromachined multielectrode array (MEA) based on a polymer resin (SU-8) [1], designed to minimize the tissue reaction around the bulk of the implant. Earlier findings show that the tissue reaction around a tethered implant is largest in the rostro-caudal direction of the CNS, they also show that size affect the gliosis[2]. Our MEA is at least an order of magnitude thinner than commercially available MEA:s, and therefore flexible in the preferred direction, i.e. in the rostro-caudal direction.</p>
      <h2>Study Design</h2>
        Probes were made of a photosensitive polymer (SU8), approximately 5 µm thick. 50 µm stainless steel wires were mounted with sucrose to the implant, and some were also coated in a thin layer of type B gelatin. Brains wercryostat-sectioned horizontally (30 µm) and immunohistochemically stained for ED1 (activated microglia/macrophages), GFAP (reactive astrocytes), NeuN (neuronal nuclei), RIP (oligodendrocytes) and DAPI (cell nuclei). Sagittally and coroncally oriented implants were compared to assess shearing damage.
