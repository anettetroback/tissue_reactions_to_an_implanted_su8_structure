        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Since the 70â€™s when neural interfaces were first described, the use and development of neural probes has only in- creased and are now used by many groups as a research tool. The long-term function of these devices depends greatly on them being biocompatible and long-term sta- ble. However, today, the produced interfaces do not fulfill these criteria.</p>

<p>We have previously reported developing a new type of micromachined multielectrode array (MEA) based on a polymer resin (SU-8) [1], designed to minimize the tissue reaction around the bulk of the implant. Earlier findings show that the tissue reaction around a tethered implant is largest in the rostro-caudal direction of the CNS, they also show that size affect the gliosis[2]. Our MEA is at least an order of magnitude thinner than commercially available MEA:s, and therefore flexible in the preferred direction, i.e. in the rostro-caudal direction.</p>
